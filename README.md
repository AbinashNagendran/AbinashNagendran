## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Abinash Nagendran, and I'm a 2nd-year student @ UOFT studying computer science, interested in all things relating to full-stack development and AI!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on preparing myself to apply for winter internships (First time doing this, I'm excited!) 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of Docker, React.js, SQL, and some parts of AWS
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that has use in the real world, doesn't have to be related to web dev, I like ML stuff too!
